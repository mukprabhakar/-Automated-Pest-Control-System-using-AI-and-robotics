# Automated Pest Control System

## Overview

The Automated Pest Control System is an innovative solution designed to revolutionize pest management in agriculture by leveraging AI, robotics, and IoT. The system aims to identify and eliminate pests in agricultural fields in real-time without using harmful chemicals, thereby enhancing crop yields and promoting sustainability.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Pest Detection**
  - **Image Recognition:** Utilizes machine learning models to detect pests from live video feeds captured by drones and ground robots.
  - **Pattern Analysis:** Predicts pest outbreaks based on environmental conditions and historical data.

- **Robotic Pest Elimination**
  - **Drones:** Equipped with precision spraying mechanisms for targeted pest control using organic or biological pesticides.
  - **Ground Robots:** Navigate through fields to mechanically remove or treat pest-infested plants.
  - **Laser Systems:** Use laser technology to accurately eliminate pests without damaging crops.

- **Sensor Networks**
  - **Environmental Sensors:** Monitor key factors like humidity and temperature that influence pest activity.
  - **Soil Sensors:** Track soil moisture and nutrient levels to detect potential pest problems.

- **Data Analytics and Reporting**
  - **Real-Time Monitoring:** Provides farmers with real-time data on pest activity and control measures through a user-friendly dashboard.
  - **Predictive Analytics:** Forecasts potential pest outbreaks and recommends preventive actions.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Spring Boot
  - RESTful APIs for system communication and data processing.
  - Data management using Spring Data JPA with relational and NoSQL databases.
  - Security implementation using Spring Security.

- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV
  - Pest detection and pattern analysis.

- **Robotics:** ROS, ArduPilot, PX4
  - Controls drones and ground robots for field operations.

- **IoT:** MQTT, AWS IoT, Google Cloud IoT
  - Communication and management of IoT devices and sensors.

- **Frontend:** React, Angular, Vue.js
  - User Dashboard for monitoring and controlling the system.

- **Cloud:** AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure
  - Cloud infrastructure for data processing and storage.

- **Communication Protocols:** Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, LoRaWAN
  - Ensures reliable communication between system components.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Java 8 or above** (for running Spring Boot)
- **Node.js** (for frontend development)
- **Docker** (for containerized deployment)
- **AWS or Google Cloud Account** (for cloud services)
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch** (for AI/ML model development)
- **ROS** (for robotics control)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/automated-pest-control-system.git
   cd automated-pest-control-system
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Build the Spring Boot application:
     ```bash
     ./mvnw clean install
     ```
   - Run the application:
     ```bash
     ./mvnw spring-boot:run
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Run the development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

4. **Deployment:**
   - Use Docker to containerize the application:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```
   - Deploy on your preferred cloud platform (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.).

## Usage

1. **User Dashboard:**
   - Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` after starting the frontend server.
   - Monitor real-time data, view reports, and control system components.

2. **API Endpoints:**
   - The backend provides RESTful APIs for managing devices, processing data, and interacting with the frontend.
   - API documentation can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

3. **Data Analytics:**
   - The system provides real-time and historical data analysis through the dashboard.
   - Predictive analytics features are available to forecast pest outbreaks and recommend actions.

## Testing

- Unit and integration tests are included in the `backend` module.
- Run tests with:
  ```bash
  ./mvnw test
